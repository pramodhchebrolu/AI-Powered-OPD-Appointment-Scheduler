# AI-Powered-OPD-Appointment-Scheduler
A smart, AI-integrated appointment management system designed to optimize patient scheduling in Outpatient Departments (OPDs). This project combines machine learning (KMeans clustering) and real-time scheduling logic to minimize overlaps, reduce idle time, and enhance operational efficiency in hospitals and clinics.

🔍Key Features

AI-Based Slot Prediction: Uses clustering to group appointment durations and identify optimal time slots.
Smart Scheduler: Dynamically allocates appointments to avoid conflicts and overlaps.
Interactive Frontend: Clean and responsive UI for booking appointments, including doctor and time slot selection.
Doctor Availability Mapping: Real-time filtering of doctors based on available time slots.
Flask-Powered Backend: Python backend handles logic and data processing, integrated seamlessly with the frontend.

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (KMeans)
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

🎯 Project Goal
To streamline the OPD appointment process using AI, ensuring better time utilization for doctors and reduced wait time for patients—ultimately improving hospital workflow and patient satisfaction.
